    "在本章中，我们将告诉您更多关于本书的期望，介绍深度学习背后的关键概念，并针对不同的任务训练我们的第一个模型。\n",
    "如果你没有技术或者数学背景，没有关系，我们写这本书是为了让尽可能多的人能够进行深度学习。\n",
    "# 深度学习适合每个人\n",
    "很多人认为你需要各种难以找到的东西才能在深度学习中取得好成绩，但正如你在这本书中看到的那样，那些人错了。\n",
    "下面列出了一些你绝对不需要做的世界级深度学习的事情。\n",
    "| 虚假情况 (不需要)      | 真实情况 |\n",

    "深度学习是一种通过使用多层神经网络来提取和转换数据的计算机技术，其用例从人类语音识别到动物图像分类。神经网络的每一层都从前一层中获取输入，并逐步细化它们。这些层是通过算法进行训练的，这些算法可以最大限度地减少它们的误差并提高它们的准确性。通过这种方式，网络学习执行指定的任务。我们将在下一节中详细讨论训练算法。\n",
    "\n",
    "深度学习具有强大、灵活和简单的特点。这就是为什么我们认为它应该被应用于许多学科。这些学科包括社会和物理科学、艺术、医学、金融、科学研究等等。举个例子，尽管没有医学背景，Jeremy还是创办了Enlitic，一家使用深度学习算法来诊断疾病的公司。该公司在创办的几个月内，就宣布其算法可以比放射科医生更准确地识别恶性肿瘤。\n",
    "\n",
    "这里列出了不同领域的数千项任务，在这些任务中，深度学习或大量使用深度学习的方法，现在是世界上最好的：\n",
    "- 自然语言处理（NLP）：回答问题；语音识别；总结文件；对文件进行分类；查找文件中的名称、日期等；搜索提到某一概念的文章\n",
    "- 计算机视觉：卫星和无人机图像解读（例如，用于抗灾）；人脸识别；图像字幕；阅读交通标志；在自动驾驶车辆中定位行人和车辆\n",
    "- 医学：在放射学图像中发现异常，包括CT、MRI和X射线图像；计算病理切片中的特征；测量超声波中的特征；诊断糖尿病性视网膜病变\n",
    "- 生物学：折叠蛋白质；对蛋白质进行分类；许多基因组学任务，如肿瘤正常测序和对临床上可操作的基因突变进行分类；细胞分类；分析蛋白质/蛋白质的相互作用\n",
    "- 图像生成：对图像进行着色；提高图像分辨率；去除图像中的噪音；将图像转换为著名艺术家风格的艺术。\n",
    "- 推荐系统：网络搜索；产品推荐；主页布局\n",
    "- 玩游戏：国际象棋、围棋、大多数雅达利视频游戏，以及许多实时战略游戏\n",
    "- 机器人：处理具有挑战性的物体（例如，透明的、有光泽的、缺乏质地的）或难以拿起的物体\n",
    "- 其他应用：金融和物流预测，文本到语音，以及更多......\n",
    "难能可贵的是，深度学习有如此多样的应用，但几乎所有的深度学习都是基于单一类型的模型，即神经网络。\n",
    "但神经网络事实上并不是什么全新的事物。为了对该领域有一个更广泛的视角，值得从一点历史开始。\n"

    "# Neural Networks: A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "1943年，神经生理学家沃伦-麦库洛赫和逻辑学家沃尔特-皮茨合作开发了一个人工神经元的数学模型。在他们的论文 \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity \"中，他们宣称：\n",
    "```                 \n",
    "由于神经活动的\"全或无\"特性，神经事件和它们之间的关系可以用命题逻辑来处理。人们发现，每个网的行为都可以用这些术语来描述。\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "麦库洛赫和皮茨意识到，一个真实神经元的简化模型可以用简单的加法和阈值表示，如下图所示。皮茨是自学成才的，在12岁时，他收到了去剑桥大学跟随伟大的伯特兰-罗素学习的邀请。他没有接受这个邀请，实际上在他的一生中也没有接受任何高级学位或权威职位的邀请。他的大部分著名作品都是在无家可归时完成的。尽管他没有得到官方认可的职位，而且越来越被社会孤立，但他与麦库洛赫的工作很有影响，并被一位名叫弗兰克-罗森布拉特的心理学家所采纳。\n",
    "\n",
    "![自然和人工神经元](../images/01.intro/neuron.png \"自然和人工神经元\")\n",
    "\n",
    "罗森布拉特进一步发展了人工神经元，使其具有学习能力。更重要的是，他致力于建造第一个真正使用这些原理的设备，即马克一号感知机。在《The Design of an Intelligent Automaton》中，罗森布拉特写到了这项工作：“我们现在即将见证这样一种机器的诞生————一种能够感知、认识和识别周围环境，而不需要任何人类训练或控制的机器”。感知机建成后，能够成功识别简单的形状。\n",
    "\n",
    "麻省理工学院一位名叫马文-明斯基的教授（他在同一所高中比罗森布拉特低一个年级！），与西摩-帕珀特一起写了一本名为《Perceptrons》（麻省理工学院出版社）的书，讲述了罗森布拉特的发明。他们表明，这些单层感知机无法学习一些简单但关键的数学功能（如异或）。在同一本书中，他们还表明，使用多层感知机将使这些限制得到解决。不幸的是，只有这些见解中的第一个被广泛认可。因此，在接下来的二十年里，全球学术界几乎完全放弃了对神经网络的研究。\n",
    "\n",
    "在过去的50年里，神经网络方面最关键的工作也许是David Rumelhart、James McClellan和PDP研究小组的多卷本《Parallel Distributed Processing》（PDP），由麻省理工学院出版社于1986年发行。第一章阐述了与罗森布拉特所展示的类似的希望：\n",
    "```\n",
    "人们比今天的计算机更聪明，因为大脑采用了一种基本的计算架构，它更适合处理人们所擅长的自然信息处理任务的一个核心方面......我们将介绍一个用于认知过程建模的计算框架，该框架似乎......比其他框架更接近于大脑可能完成的计算风格。\n",
    "```\n",
    "PDP在这里使用的前提是，传统的计算机程序与大脑的工作方式非常不同，这可能就是为什么计算机程序（在当时）在做大脑认为很容易的事情（如识别图片中的物体）方面如此糟糕。作者声称，PDP方法“比其他框架更接近”大脑的工作方式，因此它可能更好地处理这些类型的任务。\n",
    "\n",
    "事实上，PDP中规定的方法与今天的神经网络中使用的方法非常相似。该书将并行分布式处理定义为要求:\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the approach laid out in PDP is very similar to the approach used in today's neural networks. The book defined parallel distributed processing as requiring:\n",
    "1. 一组处理单元\n",
    "2. 一个激活的状态\n",
    "3. 每个单元的输出函数\n",
    "4. 单元之间的连接模式\n",
    "5. 一个通过连接网络传播活动模式的传播规则\n",
    "6. 一个激活规则，用于将影响一个单元的输入与该单元的当前状态相结合，为该单元产生一个输出\n",
    "7. 一个学习规则，通过经验改变连接模式。\n",
    "8. 一个系统必须在其中运行的环境\n",
    "\n",
    "我们将在本书中看到，现代神经网络可以满足这些要求中的每一项。\n",
    "\n",
    "在20世纪80年代，大多数模型都是用两层神经网络建立的，从而避免了明斯基和帕珀特发现的问题（这是他们的“单元之间的连接模式”，使用上面的框架）。而事实上，在80年代和90年代，神经网络被广泛用于真正的、实用的项目。然而，对理论问题的误解再次阻碍了该领域的发展。在理论上，只需增加一层额外的神经元，就足以让这些神经网络近似任何数学函数，但在实践中，这样的网络往往太大、太慢而无法发挥作用。\n",
    "\n",
    "尽管研究人员在30年前就表明，要想获得实用的良好性能，就需要使用更多的神经元层，但直到最近十年，这一原则才得到了更广泛的重视和应用。由于使用了更多的层，再加上计算机硬件的改进、数据可用性的增加以及允许神经网络更快、更容易地被训练的算法调整，神经网络现在终于发挥了其潜力。我们现在有了罗森布拉特承诺的东西： \"一台能够感知、识别和确认其周围环境的机器，不需要任何人类训练或控制\"。\n",
    "\n",
    "这就是你将在本书中学习如何建造的东西。但首先，由于我们将花很多时间在一起，让我们互相了解一下......\n"

    "\n",
    "杰里米使用并教授机器学习大约有30年了。他在25年前开始使用神经网络。在此期间，他领导了许多以机器学习为核心的公司和项目，包括创立了第一家专注于深度学习和医学的公司Enlitic，并担任了世界上最大的机器学习社区Kaggle的总裁和首席科学家。他与瑞秋-托马斯博士是fast.ai的共同创始人，该组织建立了本书所基于的课程。\n",

    "另一方面，西尔万对正规的技术教育非常了解。事实上，他已经写了10本数学教科书，涵盖了整个法国的高级数学课程！\n",
    "```\n",
    "S: 与杰里米不同的是，我没有花很多年时间编码和应用机器学习算法。相反，我是最近通过观看杰里米的fast.ai课程视频进入机器学习领域的。所以，如果你是一个没有打开过终端，没有在命令行上写过命令的人，那么你会明白我的来历。请注意我的侧边栏，以找到最适合具有更多数学或正式技术背景，但实际编码经验较少的人的信息，也就是像我这样的人......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "fast.ai课程已经有数十万学生学习过，他们来自各行各业，来自世界各地。西尔万脱颖而出，成为杰里米所见过的课程中最令人印象深刻的学生，这导致他加入fast.ai，然后与杰里米一起成为fastai软件库的共同作者。\n",
    "\n",
    "所有这一切意味着，在我们之间，你拥有两个世界中最好的东西：比其他人更了解软件的人，因为是他们写的；一个数学专家，一个编码和机器学习的专家；还有一个人，他们既了解在数学方面成为相对局外人的感觉，也了解在编码和机器学习方面成为相对局外人的感觉。\n",

    "# 如何学习深度学习\n",
    "\n",
    "哈佛大学教授大卫-帕金斯（David Perkins）写了《Making Learning Whole》（Jossey-Bass）一书，他对教学有很多话要说。其基本思想是教授整个游戏。这意味着，如果你要教棒球，你首先要带人们去看棒球比赛或让他们玩棒球。你不会教他们如何用麻绳从头开始做一个棒球，也不会教他们抛物线的物理学原理，或者球在球棒上的摩擦系数。\n",
    "\n",
    "哥伦比亚大学数学博士、前布朗大学教授、K-12数学教师保罗-洛克哈特（Paul Lockhart）在一篇颇具影响力的文章《A Mathematician's Lament》中想象了一个噩梦般的世界，在那里，音乐和艺术的教学方式与数学的教学方式相同。孩子们在花了十几年的时间掌握音乐符号和理论之前，不允许听或玩音乐，要花时间把乐谱换成不同的调。在艺术课上，学生们学习颜色和涂抹器，但直到大学才被允许真正作画。听起来很荒唐？这就是数学的教学方式————我们要求学生花数年时间死记硬背，学习枯燥无味、互不相干的基础知识，我们声称这些知识以后会有回报，而且是在他们中的大多数人退出这个学科之后很久。\n",
    "\n",
    "不幸的是，这就是许多关于深度学习的教学资源开始的地方————要求学习者跟随Hessian的定义和损失函数的泰勒近似定理，而没有给出实际工作代码的例子。我们不是在嘲笑微积分。我们喜欢微积分，Sylvain甚至在大学里也教过它，但我们认为在学习深度学习时，它并不是最好的开始！\n",
    "\n",
    "在深度学习中，如果你有动力去修复你的模型，让它做得更好，这真的很有帮助。这就是你开始学习相关理论的时候。但你首先需要有模型。我们几乎所有的东西都是通过真实的例子来教的。随着我们建立起这些例子，我们会越来越深入，我们会告诉你如何使你的项目越来越好。这意味着你将逐步学习你所需要的所有理论基础，在这个过程中，你会看到为什么它很重要，它是如何工作的。\n",
    "\n",
    "因此，这里是我们对你的承诺。在本书中，我们将遵循这些原则：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 教授整个游戏。我们将从展示如何使用一个完整的、可操作的、非常可用的、最先进的深度学习网络开始，使用简单的、可表达的工具来解决现实世界的问题。然后我们会逐渐深入了解这些工具是如何制作的，以及制作这些工具的工具是如何制作的，等等......\n",
    "\n",
    "- 始终通过实例进行教学。我们会确保有一个你能直观理解的背景和目的，而不是从代数符号的操作开始。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 尽可能地简化。我们已经花了多年时间建立工具和教学方法，使以前复杂的主题变得非常简单。\n",
    "\n",
    "- 消除障碍。到目前为止，深度学习一直是一个非常独特的游戏。我们正在打破它，并确保每个人都能玩。\n",
    "\n",
    "深度学习最难的部分是工匠精神：你怎么知道你是否有足够的数据，数据的格式是否正确，你的模型是否在正常训练，如果不正确，你应该怎么做？这就是为什么我们相信在实践中学习。就像基本的数据科学技能一样，对于深度学习，你只有通过实践经验才能变得更好。试图在理论上花费太多时间可能会适得其反。关键是编写代码并尝试解决问题：理论可以当你有背景和动机的时候再来研究。\n",
    "\n",
    "这段旅程有些时候会很艰难。有的时候，你会觉得被卡住了。不要放弃! 倒回去看书，找到最后一点你肯定没有卡住的地方，然后从那里慢慢读下去，找到第一件不清楚的事情。然后自己尝试一些代码实验，并在谷歌上搜索更多的教程，不管你遇到的问题是什么————通常你会发现一些不同角度的材料可能会有助于你。另外，在第一次阅读时不能理解所有的东西（尤其是代码）是正常的。试图在继续学习之前连续地理解材料有时是很难的。有时，当你从下一阶段的部分内容中获得更多的信息，从更大的画面中获得更多的东西后，事情就会被点击到位。因此，如果你确实在某一节上卡住了，无论如何都要试着继续前进，并记下以后再来找它。\n",
    "\n",
    "记住，你不需要任何特定的学术背景就能在深度学习方面取得成功。许多重要的突破是由没有博士学位的人在研究和工业中取得的，例如《Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks》————过去十年中最有影响力的论文之一，有超过5000次的引用，这是由Alec Radford在他还是本科生时写的。即使是在特斯拉，他们也在努力解决制造自动驾驶汽车这一极其艰难的挑战，首席执行官埃隆-马斯克说：\n",
    "\n",

    "What Is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Your classifier is a deep learning model. As was already mentioned, deep learning models use neural networks, which originally date from the 1950s and have become powerful very recently thanks to recent advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key piece of context is that deep learning is just a modern area in the more general discipline of machine learning. To understand the essence of what you did when you trained your own classification model, you don't need to understand deep learning. It is enough to see how your model and your training process are examples of the concepts that apply to machine learning in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this section, we will describe what machine learning is. We will look at the key concepts, and show how they can be traced back to the original essay that introduced them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is, like regular programming, a way to get computers to complete a specific task. But how would we use regular programming to do what we just did in the last section: recognize dogs versus cats in photos? We would have to write down for the computer the exact steps necessary to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, it's easy enough for us to write down the steps to complete a task when we're writing a program. We just think about the steps we'd take if we had to do the task by hand, and then we translate them into code. For instance, we can write a function that sorts a list. In general, we'd write a function that looks something like <<basic_program>> (where inputs might be an unsorted list, and results a sorted list).\n",

    "\n",
    "Right back at the dawn of computing, in 1949, an IBM researcher named Arthur Samuel started working on a different way to get computers to complete tasks, which he called machine learning. In his classic 1962 essay \"Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation\", he wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    ": Programming a computer for such computations is, at best, a difficult task, not primarily because of any inherent complexity in the computer itself but, rather, because of the need to spell out every minute step of the process in the most exasperating detail. Computers, as any programmer will tell you, are giant morons, not giant brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "His basic idea was this: instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples of the problem to solve, and let it figure out how to solve it itself. This turned out to be very effective: by 1961 his checkers-playing program had learned so much that it beat the Connecticut state champion! Here's how he described his idea (from the same essay as above):\n",
    "\n",
    ": Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance. We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would \"learn\" from its experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of powerful concepts embedded in this short statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a \"weight assignment\"\n",
    "The fact that every weight assignment has some \"actual performance\"\n",
    "The requirement that there be an \"automatic means\" of testing that performance,\n",
    "The need for a \"mechanism\" (i.e., another automatic process) for improving the performance by changing the weight assignments\n",
    "Let us take these concepts one by one, in order to understand how they fit together in practice. First, we need to understand what Samuel means by a weight assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights are just variables, and a weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables. The program's inputs are values that it processes in order to produce its results—for instance, taking image pixels as inputs, and returning the classification \"dog\" as a result. The program's weight assignments are other values that define how the program will operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they will affect the program they are in a sense another kind of input, so we will update our basic picture in <<basic_program>> and replace it with <<weight_assignment>> in order to take this into account.\n",

It can be implemented in many different ways. For instance, in Samuel's checkers program, different values of the weights would result in different checkers-playing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "(By the way, what Samuel called \"weights\" are most generally referred to as model parameters these days, in case you have encountered that term. The term weights is reserved for a particular type of model parameter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Samuel said we need an automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance. In the case of his checkers program, the \"actual performance\" of a model would be how well it plays. And you could automatically test the performance of two models by setting them to play against each other, and seeing which one usually wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, he says we need a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance. For instance, we could look at the difference in weights between the winning model and the losing model, and adjust the weights a little further in the winning direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see why he said that such a procedure could be made entirely automatic and... a machine so programmed would \"learn\" from its experience. Learning would become entirely automatic when the adjustment of the weights was also automatic—when instead of us improving a model by adjusting its weights manually, we relied on an automated mechanism that produced adjustments based on performance.\n",

    "jargon: Machine Learning: The training of programs developed by allowing a computer to learn from its experience, rather than through manually coding the individual steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Is a Neural Network?\n",
    "It's not too hard to imagine what the model might look like for a checkers program. There might be a range of checkers strategies encoded, and some kind of search mechanism, and then the weights could vary how strategies are selected, what parts of the board are focused on during a search, and so forth. But it's not at all obvious what the model might look like for an image recognition program, or for understanding text, or for many other interesting problems we might imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like is some kind of function that is so flexible that it could be used to solve any given problem, just by varying its weights. Amazingly enough, this function actually exists! It's the neural network, which we already discussed. That is, if you regard a neural network as a mathematical function, it turns out to be a function which is extremely flexible depending on its weights. A mathematical proof called the universal approximation theorem shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory. The fact that neural networks are so flexible means that, in practice, they are often a suitable kind of model, and you can focus your effort on the process of training them—that is, of finding good weight assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about that process? One could imagine that you might need to find a new \"mechanism\" for automatically updating weights for every problem. This would be laborious. What we'd like here as well is a completely general way to update the weights of a neural network, to make it improve at any given task. Conveniently, this also exists!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We'll see how neural networks and SGD work in detail in <<chapter_mnist_basics>>, as well as explaining the universal approximation theorem. For now, however, we will instead use Samuel's own words: We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would \"learn\" from its experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "J: Don't worry, neither SGD nor neural nets are mathematically complex. Both nearly entirely rely on addition and multiplication to do their work (but they do a lot of addition and multiplication!). The main reaction we hear from students when they see the details is: \"Is that all it is?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, to recap, a neural network is a particular kind of machine learning model, which fits right in to Samuel's original conception. Neural networks are special because they are highly flexible, which means they can solve an unusually wide range of problems just by finding the right weights. This is powerful, because stochastic gradient descent provides us a way to find those weight values automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having zoomed out, let's now zoom back in and revisit our image classification problem using Samuel's framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inputs are the images. Our weights are the weights in the neural net. Our model is a neural net. Our results are the values that are calculated by the neural net, like \"dog\" or \"cat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the next piece, an automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance? Determining \"actual performance\" is easy enough: we can simply define our model's performance as its accuracy at predicting the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, and assuming that SGD is our mechanism for updating the weight assignments, we can see how our image classifier is a machine learning model, much like Samuel envisioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bit of Deep Learning Jargon\n",
    "Samuel was working in the 1960s, and since then terminology has changed. Here is the modern deep learning terminology for all the pieces we have discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional form of the model is called its architecture (but be careful—sometimes people use model as a synonym of architecture, so this can get confusing).\n",
    "The weights are called parameters.\n",
    "The predictions are calculated from the independent variable, which is the data not including the labels.\n",
    "The results of the model are called predictions.\n",
    "The measure of performance is called the loss.\n",
    "The loss depends not only on the predictions, but also the correct labels (also known as targets or the dependent variable); e.g., \"dog\" or \"cat.\"\n",

    "Limitations Inherent To Machine Learning\n",
    "From this picture we can now see some fundamental things about training a deep learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "A model cannot be created without data.\n",
    "A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\n",
    "This learning approach only creates predictions, not recommended actions.\n",
    "It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need labels for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).\n",
    "Generally speaking, we've seen that most organizations that say they don't have enough data, actually mean they don't have enough labeled data. If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they've been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We'll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it's such an important issue in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these kinds of machine learning models can only make predictions (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you'll learn how to create a recommendation system that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (inputs) and what they went on to buy or look at (labels), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That's very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you've never heard of before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical insight comes from considering how a model interacts with its environment. This can create feedback loops, as described here:\n",
    "\n",
    "A predictive policing model is created based on where arrests have been made in the past. In practice, this is not actually predicting crime, but rather predicting arrests, and is therefore partially simply reflecting biases in existing policing processes.\n",
    "Law enforcement officers then might use that model to decide where to focus their police activity, resulting in increased arrests in those areas.\n",
    "Data on these additional arrests would then be fed back in to retrain future versions of the model.\n",
    "This is a positive feedback loop, where the more the model is used, the more biased the data becomes, making the model even more biased, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback loops can also create problems in commercial settings. For instance, a video recommendation system might be biased toward recommending content consumed by the biggest watchers of video (e.g., conspiracy theorists and extremists tend to watch more online video content than the average), resulting in those users increasing their video consumption, resulting in more of those kinds of videos being recommended. We'll consider this topic more in detail in <<chapter_ethics>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have seen the base of the theory, let's go back to our code example and see in detail how the code corresponds to the process we just described.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Our Image Recognizer Works\n",
    "Let's see just how our image recognizer code maps to these ideas. We'll put each line into a separate cell, and look at what each one is doing (we won't explain every detail of every parameter yet, but will give a description of the important bits; full details will come later in the book).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line imports all of the fastai.vision library.\n",
    "\n",
    "from fastai.vision.all import *\n",
    "This gives us all of the functions and classes we will need to create a wide variety of computer vision models.\n",
    "\n",
    "J: A lot of Python coders recommend avoiding importing a whole library like this (using the import * syntax), because in large software projects it can cause problems. However, for interactive work such as in a Jupyter notebook, it works great. The fastai library is specially designed to support this kind of interactive use, and it will only import the necessary pieces into your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line downloads a standard dataset from the fast.ai datasets collection (if not previously downloaded) to your server, extracts it (if not previously extracted), and returns a Path object with the extracted location:\n",
    "\n",
    "path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'\n",
    "S: Throughout my time studying at fast.ai, and even still today, I've learned a lot about productive coding practices. The fastai library and fast.ai notebooks are full of great little tips that have helped make me a better programmer. For instance, notice that the fastai library doesn't just return a string containing the path to the dataset, but a Path object. This is a really useful class from the Python 3 standard library that makes accessing files and directories much easier. If you haven't come across it before, be sure to check out its documentation or a tutorial and try it out. Note that the https://book.fast.ai%5Bwebsite] contains links to recommended tutorials for each chapter. I'll keep letting you know about little coding tips I've found useful as we come across them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third line we define a function, is_cat, which labels cats based on a filename rule provided by the dataset creators:\n",
    "\n",
    "def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()\n",
    "We use that function in the fourth line, which tells fastai what kind of dataset we have and how it is structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\n",
    "    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,\n",
    "    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))\n",
    "There are various different classes for different kinds of deep learning datasets and problems—here we're using ImageDataLoaders. The first part of the class name will generally be the type of data you have, such as image, or text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important piece of information that we have to tell fastai is how to get the labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of the filename, or path—most commonly the parent folder name. fastai comes with a number of standardized labeling methods, and ways to write your own. Here we're telling fastai to use the is_cat function we just defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define the Transforms that we need. A Transform contains code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined Transforms, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds: item_tfms are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square), while batch_tfms are applied to a batch of items at a time using the GPU, so they're particularly fast (we'll see many examples of these throughout this book).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase the size, you'll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is true if you decrease the size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Classification and Regression: classification and regression have very specific meanings in machine learning. These are the two main types of model that we will be investigating in this book. A classification model is one which attempts to predict a class, or category. That is, it's predicting from a number of discrete possibilities, such as \"dog\" or \"cat.\" A regression model is one which attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as a temperature or a location. Sometimes people use the word regression to refer to a particular kind of model called a linear regression model; this is a bad practice, and we won't be using that terminology in this book!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pet dataset contains 7,390 pictures of dogs and cats, consisting of 37 different breeds. Each image is labeled using its filename: for instance the file great_pyrenees_173.jpg is the 173rd example of an image of a Great Pyrenees breed dog in the dataset. The filenames start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise. We have to tell fastai how to get labels from the filenames, which we do by calling from_name_func (which means that labels can be extracted using a function applied to the filename), and passing is_cat, which returns x[0].isupper(), which evaluates to True if the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it's a cat).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important parameter to mention here is valid_pct=0.2. This tells fastai to hold out 20% of the data and not use it for training the model at all. This 20% of the data is called the validation set; the remaining 80% is called the training set. The validation set is used to measure the accuracy of the model. By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly. The parameter seed=42 sets the random seed to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "fastai will always show you your model's accuracy using only the validation set, never the training set. This is absolutely critical, because if you train a large enough model for a long enough time, it will eventually memorize the label of every item in your dataset! The result will not actually be a useful model, because what we care about is how well our model works on previously unseen images. That is always our goal when creating a model: for it to be useful on data that the model only sees in the future, after it has been trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when your model has not fully memorized all your data, earlier on in training it may have memorized certain parts of it. As a result, the longer you train for, the better your accuracy will get on the training set; the validation set accuracy will also improve for a while, but eventually it will start getting worse as the model starts to memorize the training set, rather than finding generalizable underlying patterns in the data. When this happens, we say that the model is overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<<img_overfit>> shows what happens when you overfit, using a simplified example where we have just one parameter, and some randomly generated data based on the function x**2. As you can see, although the predictions in the overfit model are accurate for data near the observed data points, they are way off when outside of that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of overfitting\n",
    "Overfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training for all machine learning practitioners, and all algorithms. As you will see, it is very easy to create a model that does a great job at making predictions on the exact data it has been trained on, but it is much harder to make accurate predictions on data the model has never seen before. And of course, this is the data that will actually matter in practice. For instance, if you create a handwritten digit classifier (as we will very soon!) and use it to recognize numbers written on checks, then you are never going to see any of the numbers that the model was trained on—checks will have slightly different variations of writing to deal with. You will learn many methods to avoid overfitting in this book. However, you should only use those methods after you have confirmed that overfitting is actually occurring (i.e., you have actually observed the validation accuracy getting worse during training). We often see practitioners using over-fitting avoidance techniques even when they have enough data that they didn't need to do so, ending up with a model that may be less accurate than what they could have achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "important: Validation Set: When you train a model, you must always have both a training set and a validation set, and must measure the accuracy of your model only on the validation set. If you train for too long, with not enough data, you will see the accuracy of your model start to get worse; this is called overfitting. fastai defaults valid_pct to 0.2, so even if you forget, fastai will create a validation set for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth line of the code training our image recognizer tells fastai to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) and specifies what architecture to use (i.e. what kind of model to create), what data we want to train it on, and what metric to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\n",
    "Why a CNN? It's the current state-of-the-art approach to creating computer vision models. We'll be learning all about how CNNs work in this book. Their structure is inspired by how the human vision system works.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different architectures in fastai, which we will introduce in this book (as well as discussing how to create your own). Most of the time, however, picking an architecture isn't a very important part of the deep learning process. It's something that academics love to talk about, but in practice it is unlikely to be something you need to spend much time on. There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called ResNet that we'll be talking a lot about during the book; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The 34 in resnet34 refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are 18, 50, 101, and 152). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse). On the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a metric? A metric is a function that measures the quality of the model's predictions using the validation set, and will be printed at the end of each epoch. In this case, we're using error_rate, which is a function provided by fastai that does just what it says: tells you what percentage of images in the validation set are being classified incorrectly. Another common metric for classification is accuracy (which is just 1.0 - error_rate). fastai provides many more, which will be discussed throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a metric may remind you of loss, but there is an important distinction. The entire purpose of loss is to define a \"measure of performance\" that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "vision_learner also has a parameter pretrained, which defaults to True (so it's used in this case, even though we haven't specified it), which sets the weights in your model to values that have already been trained by experts to recognize a thousand different categories across 1.3 million photos (using the famous ImageNet dataset). A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a pretrained model. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. And, as you'll see, in a deep learning model many of these capabilities are things you'll need, almost regardless of the details of your project. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a pretrained model, vision_learner will remove the last layer, since that is always specifically customized to the original training task (i.e. ImageNet dataset classification), and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with. This last part of the model is known as the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pretrained models is the most important method we have to allow us to train more accurate models, more quickly, with less data, and less time and money. You might think that would mean that using pretrained models would be the most studied area in academic deep learning... but you'd be very, very wrong! The importance of pretrained models is generally not recognized or discussed in most courses, books, or software library features, and is rarely considered in academic papers. As we write this at the start of 2020, things are just starting to change, but it's likely to take a while. So be careful: most people you speak to will probably greatly underestimate what you can do in deep learning with few resources, because they probably won't deeply understand how to use pretrained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for is known as transfer learning. Unfortunately, because transfer learning is so under-studied, few domains have pretrained models available. For instance, there are currently few pretrained models available in medicine, making transfer learning challenging to use in that domain. In addition, it is not yet well understood how to use transfer learning for tasks such as time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "jargon: Transfer learning: Using a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth line of our code tells fastai how to fit the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "learn.fine_tune(1)\n",
    "As we've discussed, the architecture only describes a template for a mathematical function; it doesn't actually do anything until we provide values for the millions of parameters it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key to deep learning—determining how to fit the parameters of a model to get it to solve your problem. In order to fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of epochs). The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model. If you select a number that is too small, you can always train for more epochs later.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is the method called fine_tune, and not fit? fastai actually does have a method called fit, which does indeed fit a model (i.e. look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels). But in this case, we've started with a pretrained model, and we don't want to throw away all those capabilities that it already has. As you'll learn in this book, there are some important tricks to adapt a pretrained model for a new dataset—a process called fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "jargon: Fine-tuning: A transfer learning technique where the parameters of a pretrained model are updated by training for additional epochs using a different task to that used for pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the fine_tune method, fastai will use these tricks for you. There are a few parameters you can set (which we'll discuss later), but in the default form shown here, it does two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to get the new random head to work correctly with your dataset.\n",
    "Use the number of epochs requested when calling the method to fit the entire model, updating the weights of the later layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers (which, as we'll see, generally don't require many changes from the pretrained weights).\n",
    "The head of a model is the part that is newly added to be specific to the new dataset. An epoch is one complete pass through the dataset. After calling fit, the results after each epoch are printed, showing the epoch number, the training and validation set losses (the \"measure of performance\" used for training the model), and any metrics you've requested (error rate, in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with all this code our model learned to recognize cats and dogs just from labeled examples. But how did it do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "What Our Image Recognizer Learned\n",
    "At this stage we have an image recognizer that is working very well, but we have no idea what it is actually doing! Although many people complain that deep learning results in impenetrable \"black box\" models (that is, something that gives predictions but that no one can understand), this really couldn't be further from the truth. There is a vast body of research showing how to deeply inspect deep learning models, and get rich insights from them. Having said that, all kinds of machine learning models (including deep learning, and traditional statistical models) can be challenging to fully understand, especially when considering how they will behave when coming across data that is very different to the data used to train them. We'll be discussing this issue throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013 a PhD student, Matt Zeiler, and his supervisor, Rob Fergus, published the paper \"Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks\", which showed how to visualize the neural network weights learned in each layer of a model. They carefully analyzed the model that won the 2012 ImageNet competition, and used this analysis to greatly improve the model, such that they were able to go on to win the 2013 competition! <<img_layer1>> is the picture that they published of the first layer's weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activations of the first layer of a CNN\n",
    "This picture requires some explanation. For each layer, the image part with the light gray background shows the reconstructed weights pictures, and the larger section at the bottom shows the parts of the training images that most strongly matched each set of weights. For layer 1, what we can see is that the model has discovered weights that represent diagonal, horizontal, and vertical edges, as well as various different gradients. (Note that for each layer only a subset of the features are shown; in practice there are thousands across all of the layers.) These are the basic building blocks that the model has learned for computer vision. They have been widely analyzed by neuroscientists and computer vision researchers, and it turns out that these learned building blocks are very similar to the basic visual machinery in the human eye, as well as the handcrafted computer vision features that were developed prior to the days of deep learning. The next layer is represented in <<img_layer2>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activations of the second layer of a CNN\n",
    "For layer 2, there are nine examples of weight reconstructions for each of the features found by the model. We can see that the model has learned to create feature detectors that look for corners, repeating lines, circles, and other simple patterns. These are built from the basic building blocks developed in the first layer. For each of these, the right-hand side of the picture shows small patches from actual images which these features most closely match. For instance, the particular pattern in row 2, column 1 matches the gradients and textures associated with sunsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<<img_layer3>> shows the image from the paper showing the results of reconstructing the features of layer 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activations of the third layer of a CNN\n",
    "As you can see by looking at the righthand side of this picture, the features are now able to identify and match with higher-level semantic components, such as car wheels, text, and flower petals. Using these components, layers four and five can identify even higher-level concepts, as shown in <<img_layer4>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activations of layers 4 and 5 of a CNN\n",
    "This article was studying an older model called AlexNet that only contained five layers. Networks developed since then can have hundreds of layers—so you can imagine how rich the features developed by these models can be!\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fine-tuned our pretrained model earlier, we adapted what those last layers focus on (flowers, humans, animals) to specialize on the cats versus dogs problem. More generally, we could specialize such a pretrained model on many different tasks. Let's have a look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Recognizers Can Tackle Non-Image Tasks\n",
    "An image recognizer can, as its name suggests, only recognize images. But a lot of things can be represented as images, which means that an image recogniser can learn to complete many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a sound can be converted to a spectrogram, which is a chart that shows the amount of each frequency at each time in an audio file. Fast.ai student Ethan Sutin used this approach to easily beat the published accuracy of a state-of-the-art environmental sound detection model using a dataset of 8,732 urban sounds. fastai's show_batch clearly shows how each different sound has a quite distinctive spectrogram, as you can see in <<img_spect>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "show_batch with spectrograms of sounds\n",
    "A time series can easily be converted into an image by simply plotting the time series on a graph. However, it is often a good idea to try to represent your data in a way that makes it as easy as possible to pull out the most important components. In a time series, things like seasonality and anomalies are most likely to be of interest. There are various transformations available for time series data. For instance, fast.ai student Ignacio Oguiza created images from a time series dataset for olive oil classification, using a technique called Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF); you can see the result in <<ts_image>>. He then fed those images to an image classification model just like the one you see in this chapter. His results, despite having only 30 training set images, were well over 90% accurate, and close to the state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting a time series into an image\n",
    "Another interesting fast.ai student project example comes from Gleb Esman. He was working on fraud detection at Splunk, using a dataset of users' mouse movements and mouse clicks. He turned these into pictures by drawing an image where the position, speed, and acceleration of the mouse pointer was displayed using coloured lines, and the clicks were displayed using small colored circles, as shown in <>. He then fed this into an image recognition model just like the one we've used in this chapter, and it worked so well that it led to a patent for this approach to fraud analytics!\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting computer mouse behavior to an image\n",
    "Another example comes from the paper \"Malware Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\" by Mahmoud Kalash et al., which explains that \"the malware binary file is divided into 8-bit sequences which are then converted to equivalent decimal values. This decimal vector is reshaped and a gray-scale image is generated that represents the malware sample,\" like in <<malware_proc>>.\n",

    "Malware examples\n",
    "As you can see, the different types of malware look very distinctive to the human eye. The model the researchers trained based on this image representation was more accurate at malware classification than any previous approach shown in the academic literature. This suggests a good rule of thumb for converting a dataset into an image representation: if the human eye can recognize categories from the images, then a deep learning model should be able to do so too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you'll find that a small number of general approaches in deep learning can go a long way, if you're a bit creative in how you represent your data! You shouldn't think of approaches like the ones described here as \"hacky workarounds,\" because actually they often (as here) beat previously state-of-the-art results.

    "With this vocabulary in hand, we are now in a position to bring together all the key concepts introduced so far. Take a moment to review those definitions and read the following summary. If you can follow the explanation, then you're well equipped to understand the discussions to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a discipline where we define a program not by writing it entirely ourselves, but by learning from data. Deep learning is a specialty within machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. Image classification is a representative example (also known as image recognition). We start with labeled data; that is, a set of images where we have assigned a label to each image indicating what it represents. Our goal is to produce a program, called a model, which, given a new image, will make an accurate prediction regarding what that new image represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model starts with a choice of architecture, a general template for how that kind of model works internally. The process of training (or fitting) the model is the process of finding a set of parameter values (or weights) that specialize that general architecture into a model that works well for our particular kind of data. In order to define how well a model does on a single prediction, we need to define a loss function, which determines how we score a prediction as good or bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the training process go faster, we might start with a pretrained model—a model that has already been trained on someone else's data. We can then adapt it to our data by training it a bit more on our data, a process called fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a model, a key concern is to ensure that our model generalizes—that is, that it learns general lessons from our data which also apply to new items it will encounter, so that it can make good predictions on those items. The risk is that if we train our model badly, instead of learning general lessons it effectively memorizes what it has already seen, and then it will make poor predictions about new images. Such a failure is called overfitting. In order to avoid this, we always divide our data into two parts, the training set and the validation set. We train the model by showing it only the training set and then we evaluate how well the model is doing by seeing how well it performs on items from the validation set. In this way, we check if the lessons the model learns from the training set are lessons that generalize to the validation set. In order for a person to assess how well the model is doing on the validation set overall, we define a metric. During the training process, when the model has seen every item in the training set, we call that an epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these concepts apply to machine learning in general. That is, they apply to all sorts of schemes for defining a model by training it with data. What makes deep learning distinctive is a particular class of architectures: the architectures based on neural networks. In particular, tasks like image classification rely heavily on convolutional neural networks, which we will discuss shortly.\n",

    "Deep Learning Is Not Just for Image Classification\n",

    "You’ve already seen quite a few models in this section, each one trained using a different dataset to do a different task. In machine learning and deep learning, we can’t do anything without data. So, the people that create datasets for us to train our models on are the (often underappreciated) heroes. Some of the most useful and important datasets are those that become important academic baselines; that is, datasets that are widely studied by researchers and used to compare algorithmic changes. Some of these become household names (at least, among households that train models!), such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used in this book have been selected because they provide great examples of the kinds of data that you are likely to encounter, and the academic literature has many examples of model results using these datasets to which you can compare your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most datasets used in this book took the creators a lot of work to build. For instance, later in the book we’ll be showing you how to create a model that can translate between French and English. The key input to this is a French/English parallel text corpus prepared back in 2009 by Professor Chris Callison-Burch of the University of Pennsylvania. This dataset contains over 20 million sentence pairs in French and English. He built the dataset in a really clever way: by crawling millions of Canadian web pages (which are often multilingual) and then using a set of simple heuristics to transform URLs of French content onto URLs pointing to the same content in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you look at datasets throughout this book, think about where they might have come from, and how they might have been curated. Then think about what kinds of interesting datasets you could create for your own projects. (We’ll even take you step by step through the process of creating your own image dataset soon.)\n",
    "\n",
    "fast.ai has spent a lot of time creating cut-down versions of popular datasets that are specially designed to support rapid prototyping and experimentation, and to be easier to learn with. In this book we will often start by using one of the cut-down versions and later scale up to the full-size version (just as we're doing in this chapter!). In fact, this is how the world’s top practitioners do their modeling in practice; they do most of their experimentation and prototyping with subsets of their data, and only use the full dataset when they have a good understanding of what they have to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "End sidebar\n",
    "Each of the models we trained showed a training and validation loss. A good validation set is one of the most important pieces of the training process. Let's see why and learn how to create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Sets and Test Sets\n",
    "As we've discussed, the goal of a model is to make predictions about data. But the model training process is fundamentally dumb. If we trained a model with all our data, and then evaluated the model using that same data, we would not be able to tell how well our model can perform on data it hasn’t seen. Without this very valuable piece of information to guide us in training our model, there is a very good chance it would become good at making predictions about that data but would perform poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, our first step was to split our dataset into two sets: the training set (which our model sees in training) and the validation set, also known as the development set (which is used only for evaluation). This lets us test that the model learns lessons from the training data that generalize to new data, the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to understand this situation is that, in a sense, we don't want our model to get good results by \"cheating.\" If it makes an accurate prediction for a data item, that should be because it has learned characteristics of that kind of item, and not because the model has been shaped by actually having seen that particular item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting off our validation data means our model never sees it in training and so is completely untainted by it, and is not cheating in any way. Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, not necessarily. The situation is more subtle. This is because in realistic scenarios we rarely build a model just by training its weight parameters once. Instead, we are likely to explore many versions of a model through various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors we will discuss in upcoming chapters. Many of these choices can be described as choices of hyperparameters. The word reflects that they are parameters about parameters, since they are the higher-level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that even though the ordinary training process is only looking at predictions on the training data when it learns values for the weight parameters, the same is not true of us. We, as modelers, are evaluating the model by looking at predictions on the validation data when we decide to explore new hyperparameter values! So subsequent versions of the model are, indirectly, shaped by us having seen the validation data. Just as the automatic training process is in danger of overfitting the training data, we are in danger of overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this conundrum is to introduce another level of even more highly reserved data, the test set. Just as we hold back the validation data from the training process, we must hold back the test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model; it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts. In effect, we define a hierarchy of cuts of our data, based on how fully we want to hide it from training and modeling processes: training data is fully exposed, the validation data is less exposed, and test data is totally hidden. This hierarchy parallels the different kinds of modeling and evaluation processes themselves—the automatic training process with back propagation, the more manual process of trying different hyper-parameters between training sessions, and the assessment of our final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy. If you're creating a cat detector, for instance, you generally want at least 30 cats in your validation set. That means that if you have a dataset with thousands of items, using the default 20% validation set size may be more than you need. On the other hand, if you have lots of data, using some of it for validation probably doesn't have any downsides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having two levels of \"reserved data\"—a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself—may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we always need a separate test set—if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set—but generally it's best to use one if at all possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same discipline can be critical if you intend to hire a third party to perform modeling work on your behalf. A third party might not understand your requirements accurately, or their incentives might even encourage them to misunderstand them. A good test set can greatly mitigate these risks and let you evaluate whether their work solves your actual problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it bluntly, if you're a senior decision maker in your organization (or you're advising senior decision makers), the most important takeaway is this: if you ensure that you really understand what test and validation sets are and why they're important, then you'll avoid the single biggest source of failures we've seen when organizations decide to use AI. For instance, if you're considering bringing in an external vendor or service, make sure that you hold out some test data that the vendor never gets to see. Then you check their model on your test data, using a metric that you choose based on what actually matters to you in practice, and you decide what level of performance is adequate. (It's also a good idea for you to try out some simple baseline yourself, so you know what a really simple model can achieve. Often it'll turn out that your simple model performs just as well as one produced by an external \"expert\"!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Judgment in Defining Test Sets\n",
    "To do a good job of defining a validation set (and possibly a test set), you will sometimes want to do more than just randomly grab a fraction of your original dataset. Remember: a key property of the validation and test sets is that they must be representative of the new data you will see in the future. This may sound like an impossible order! By definition, you haven’t seen this data yet. But you usually still do know some things.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's instructive to look at a few example cases. Many of these examples come from predictive modeling competitions on the Kaggle platform, which is a good representation of problems and methods you might see in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One case might be if you are looking at time series data. For a time series, choosing a random subset of the data will be both too easy (you can look at the data both before and after the dates you are trying to predict) and not representative of most business use cases (where you are using historical data to build a model for use in the future). If your data includes the date and you are building a model to use in the future, you will want to choose a continuous section with the latest dates as your validation set (for instance, the last two weeks or last month of available data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to split the time series data in <> into training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A serie of values\n",
    "A random subset is a poor choice (too easy to fill in the gaps, and not indicative of what you'll need in production), as we can see in <>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random training subset\n",
    "Instead, use the earlier data as your training set (and the later data for the validation set), as shown in <>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training subset using the data up to a certain timestamp\n",
    "For example, Kaggle had a competition to predict the sales in a chain of Ecuadorian grocery stores. Kaggle's training data ran from Jan 1 2013 to Aug 15 2017, and the test data spanned Aug 16 2017 to Aug 31 2017. That way, the competition organizer ensured that entrants were making predictions for a time period that was in the future, from the perspective of their model. This is similar to the way quant hedge fund traders do back-testing to check whether their models are predictive of future periods, based on past data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second common case is when you can easily anticipate ways the data you will be making predictions for in production may be qualitatively different from the data you have to train your model with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kaggle distracted driver competition, the independent variables are pictures of drivers at the wheel of a car, and the dependent variables are categories such as texting, eating, or safely looking ahead. Lots of pictures are of the same drivers in different positions, as we can see in <<img_driver>>. If you were an insurance company building a model from this data, note that you would be most interested in how the model performs on drivers it hasn't seen before (since you would likely have training data only for a small group of people). In recognition of this, the test data for the competition consists of images of people that don't appear in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two pictures from the training data, showing the same driver\n",
    "If you put one of the images in <<img_driver>> in your training set and one in the validation set, your model will have an easy time making a prediction for the one in the validation set, so it will seem to be performing better than it would on new people. Another perspective is that if you used all the people in training your model, your model might be overfitting to particularities of those specific people, and not just learning the states (texting, eating, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar dynamic was at work in the Kaggle fisheries competition to identify the species of fish caught by fishing boats in order to reduce illegal fishing of endangered populations. The test set consisted of boats that didn't appear in the training data. This means that you'd want your validation set to include boats that are not in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it may not be clear how your validation data will differ. For instance, for a problem using satellite imagery, you'd need to gather more information on whether the training set just contained certain geographic locations, or if it came from geographically scattered data.\n",

    "Now that you have gotten a taste of how to build a model, you can decide what you want to dig into next.\n",

So, we've prepared a list of questions and suggested steps to complete at the end of each chapter. All the answers are in the text of the chapter, so if you're not sure about anything here, reread that part of the text and make sure you understand it. Answers to all these questions are also available on the book's website. You can also visit the forums if you get stuck to get help from other folks studying this material.\n",
